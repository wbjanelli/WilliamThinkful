      <h2><i>Welcome</i></h2>
      <p class="textfun">I am an aspiring software engineer living in Bend, Oregon.</p>
      <p class="textfun">As I transition into this exciting career, I am interested in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Creating retail and small business websites</li>
        <li>Web3/Blockchain</li>
        <li>AI (Artificial Intelligence)</li>

      <h3><i>About Me</i></h3>
      <p class="about">
        After graduating college with a B.A in Business Administration and a minor in Sustainability, I spent the next few years working as a teacher overseas and freelancing website projects.<br><br>
        I have been creating/managing small business websites for over 10 years using template website builders, now learning the codes and structures to take my work to the next level.
        I am enrolled in the Thinkful's Software Engineering program to learn and master my coding skills. I plan to apply my knowledge and business background to work on meaningful projects in the fast-paced Web3 space. This will help to increase efficiency and sustainability in the modern world.<br><br>
        In my free time, I love to travel (55 countries and counting) and enjoy surfing, snowboarding, golf, hiking, and cooking. I approach life with a worldly view and can easily adapt to any situation I find myself in. I am also bilingual, speaking English and Spanish.
